transfers all data from its standard input to its standard output.
Unlike the normal pipe, the data is read into the programs memory and the
printed out again.
This slows down the data transfer significantly.

This tool is designed to be used for testing other command line utilities.

In \fIfast mode\fR, the C library I/O buffering remains enabled and might speed up the
transfer process.
